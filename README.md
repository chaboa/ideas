## Games
----------
#### Fledgling
  - pixel, top down, tarkov
    - multiplayer?
    - light limited (gear/environment based fog of war)
    - directional sounds, footsteps/gunfire
    - taking cover as protection but restricts visibility

#### Adolescent
  - pixel tarkov
    - create light physics first
      - view is blocked by objects, can't see past them
