## Games
#### Fledgling
  - pixel, top down, tarkov
    - multiplayer?
    - light limited (gear/environment based fog of war)
    - directional sounds, footsteps/gunfire
    - taking cover as protection but restricts visibility
    

#### Adolescent
  - pixel tarkov
    - create light physics first
      - view is blocked by objects, can't see past them
      - Picture peaking into a doorway and a 3 man squad runs accross a thin strip of visibility through the door and back into the shadows -- whats your next move?
          * the top-down allows tactical planning using the 3rd person perspective of the map 
          * "fog of war" and nightvision/personal light source (various levels + restrictions) main barrier for PVP and PVE
    - Factor in "3D Damamge" meaning battles are rendered in 2D for the player but actual bullet trajectory and recoil exists?
